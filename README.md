# Slots

Simple slots clone that still needs work. I built this to get used to working with Vue and Firebase.

## How it works

You play a type of slots with the given money. When the money is over or you press 'Reset', the game
logs a leaderboard entry in Firebase and updates the leaderboard table. Realtime updates will be
coming soon.

## How to play

Clone or download the repo to your computer and access `index.html` from your web browser. Something
along the lines of

```
file://path/to/index.html
```
